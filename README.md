Overview

In this project, we are going to show the Fibonacci and Golden Sections in Nature through an openGL
program. This project is aimed at showing the various applications and manifestations of a fibonacci
series in the nature as well our day to day life. We have demonstrated 4 applications of the series and they
are:-Fibonacci Clock,Fibonacci distance Converter, Golden Spiral and Fibonacci Series Generator. The
source program is written using C/C++ and the opengl library. It is implemented on the CodeBlocks. The
program involves the keyboard interactions and other visual graphics which tends to make the output
more interactive and user-friendly. In keyboard we can use different keys such as numeric numbers to
enter a number and use them for conversions. We also make use of mouse buttons for generation of the
fibonacci sequence and building of the bezier curve. We have also provide an interactive menu which will
help the user to switch between different applications.


STEPS:

1. Codeblocks IDE (LINK - https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/16.01/Windows/codeblocks-16.01mingw-setup.exe/download)
2. Freeglut (LINK - https://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/)

<--ABOVE TWO FILES ARE PROVIDED IN THIS CD-->

3. Extract freeglut zip & follow the steps in the video (LINK - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pak-Z6uQjAQ&t=)
4. Now just copy the code of file: "FIbonacci & golden Sections in Nature.cpp" and run the project. There are two Windows, one main and other provides Instruction to help you go through the project.

<-- Set Compiler to: C++11 ISO LANGUAGE STANDARD [-std=c++11]-->
